        <div class="grid-item text1">While Adolf Sax's original patent included 14 variations to the saxophone (see <a href="history.html">History</a>), most modern saxophones are one of six variations.
        These six types can be split into two families: Eb and Bb. The Eb group contains the Sopranino, Alto, and Baritone saxophone. The Bb group has the Soprano, Tenor, and Bass saxophones.
        The ranges of the two families overlap, alternating between families as you go up the musical scale. Sopranino has the highest ranges, followed by Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Baritone, and Bass saxophones respectively.
        The reason they are split into two families is because each family is in a different key, the Eb family is in the key of Eb and Bb is in Bb.</div>
        <div class="grid-item text2">The reason saxophones are in different keys is to easily cover a wide range of notes between instruments without having to change fingering positions for different notes.
        Often times in smaller orchestras, one person would have to play multiple instruments to cover a wider range of expression. If, for example, a composition might call for a Soprano and Baritone saxophone. 
        If they were in the same key, writing the music would be easier, because you wouldn't have to switch which key you're writing in every time you had to switch instruments. But this makes it harder for the performer
        because a note on one saxophone would have a different fingering on the other, even if the note sounds the same. By changing the key of the music instead of the fingering patterns on the saxophone, performers can easily switch between instruments of two different keys.
        This also applies for Flutes and Clarinets, as fingering for these instruments are also very similar. The Flute was the first widespread woodwind, and is in Concert key, or C, which is the same as a piano.
