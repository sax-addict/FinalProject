        <div class="grid-item text1">When it comes to music, there are 7 main notes, named after the first 7 letters of the alphabet, A through G. Most of these notes are a "whole step" apart, and when you go a whole step further from G you get back to A.
            This new A is an octave higher than the last, which is twice the frequency of the sound wave. most musical compositions use notes from eight different octaves, A0 to C8, which is the range of a piano. If you play from any C to the next C, you get a major scale.
            <p>In between these letter notes are 5 "half steps" characterized by the note before in in a scale. Often called <b>Accidental</b> notes, these half steps are called either <b>Sharp (#)</b> or <b>Flat (b)</b>. Most scales use all sharps or all flats. 
            Because there are only 5 half step notes, they are unevenly spaced between whole step notes, but they remain consistent throughout all music. There is always a halfstep between A and B, called either A# (A Sharp) or Bb (B Flat). There are also half steps between C and D, D and E, F and G, and G and A.
            They follow the same pattern of being the lower note sharpened or the higher note flattened.There are no half steps between B and C and E and F, so we say these are a half step away from each other.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item text2">There are quite a few types of scales, but the two main ones are major and minor. Scales always follow the same step pattern, making the same sized steps for each note. The second note in a major scale is always a whole step from the first, as well as the third from the second.
             The whole pattern for a major scale is whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half, or W-W-H-W-W-W-H. Lets take Eb major for example, the key that alto saxophones are in. Since it Starts on Eb, we know that all accidentals will be flat. We start on an Eb, then go up to F, since it is a half step from Eb to E and another from E to F.
             Then another whole step is G. Then Ab, Bb, C, D, and back to Eb an octave up.
            <p>But what if you don't know whether to use sharps or flats? Scales also have another rule to help us out with this. In every scale, each letter will only be used once. Lets take A Major for example. We start with A, and go to B. The next note is C#/Db, but which one do we use?
                Well we know the note after is D, since it is a half step up from C#/Db. Since scales use each letter once, we can't call it Db because then we'd have two D's in the scale, and end up having no C's. So we call it C#.
